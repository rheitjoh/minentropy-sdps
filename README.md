This repository contains scripts for calculating the min-entropy generated by various non-local games as part of my master's thesis.
Most of the work is done via the [ncpol2sdpa](https://github.com/peterjbrown519/ncpol2sdpa) Python package.
Min-entropy scripts are based on [this script](https://github.com/peterjbrown519/im_divergences/blob/master/h2_global_chsh_example.py.)
